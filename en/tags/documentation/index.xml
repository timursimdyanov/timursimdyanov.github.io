      <title>Lightweight Markup Languages</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;lightweight-markup-languages&#34;&gt;Lightweight Markup Languages&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lightweight markup languages have become a standard for preparing scientific and technical texts due to their simplicity and versatility. They allow structuring documents, adding links, tables, images, and formulas without the need for complex formats or specialized software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most widely used example is &lt;strong&gt;Markdown&lt;/strong&gt;, which is actively applied in academia, software development, and documentation. Its main advantage lies in the readability of the source text: even without rendering, the document remains understandable. This makes it a convenient tool both for drafting and for publishing materials online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other languages, such as &lt;strong&gt;reStructuredText&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;AsciiDoc&lt;/strong&gt;, provide extended capabilities for structuring information, making them especially useful in large projects and for preparing official documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use of lightweight markup languages supports the unification of approaches to text processing, accelerates collaborative editing, and ensures integration with modern version control systems and publishing platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Preparing a Work Report</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;preparing-a-work-report&#34;&gt;Preparing a Work Report&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A work report is an important tool for documenting results, analyzing completed steps, and setting further objectives. Its structure depends on the purpose of the document and the context of its use, but some general principles remain consistent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The introduction of the report outlines the goals and objectives that were to be achieved. This is followed by a description of the methodology: the approaches used, the tools applied, and the rationale for selecting specific methods. The main body of the report presents the results, where it is essential not only to list the facts but also to provide their analytical interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concluding section contains conclusions and recommendations. Here the effectiveness of the work is evaluated, and the prospects for further development of the project or research are identified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A well-prepared report contributes to knowledge systematization, increases transparency of activities, and serves as a foundation for management decisions or academic evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;
